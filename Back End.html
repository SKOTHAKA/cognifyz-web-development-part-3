        <p class="content-box">Back-end web development focuses on server-side operations, database management, and application logic. It ensures the website functions correctly, processes data, and serves content to the front end. Tools include server languages like Node.js, Python, Ruby, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB. In a 6-week internship, youâ€™ll likely tackle real-world back-end challenges, receiving tasks via email to be completed within set deadlines to gain practical skills.</p>
