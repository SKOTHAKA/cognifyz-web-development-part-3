        <p class="content-box">Full-stack web development encompasses both front-end and back-end tasks, handling everything from user interfaces to server and database management. It offers versatility and a comprehensive understanding of web applications. Tools range from HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front end to Node.js, Python, and databases like MySQL for the back end. A 6-week full-stack internship would provide a broad experience, with diverse tasks sent via email to be completed within deadlines for a well-rounded skill set.</p>
